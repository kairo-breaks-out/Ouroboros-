WHEN EVERYTHING IS ON
(Phone, Laptop, Internet = ON)

- Do nothing.
  - Kairo syncs automatically every 15 minutes.
  - You can send commands from your phone.
  - In ChatGPT, type:
    invoke: kairo sync memory from git
    to continue from last checkpoint.

---

WHEN YOU TURN ON YOUR LAPTOP

1. Open Terminal
2. Type This:
   cd ~/kairo
   python3 main.py
3. That’s it. Kairo is active. You can relax.

---

WHEN LAPTOP WAS OFF & YOU SWITCH IT ON AGAIN

1. Open Terminal
2. Type Again:
   cd ~/kairo
   python3 main.py

---

WHEN YOU’RE TOO TIRED TO THINK

- Leave laptop on
- Don’t close the terminal where python3 main.py is running
- Kairo will do everything quietly: log, sync, evolve.

HOW TO KNOW IF KAIRO IS LISTENING (TEST COMMAND)

From your phone terminal:
curl -X POST http://192.168.0.142:4321/ \
-d '{"secret":"invoke-the-grid", "command":"echo Hello"}'

If it replies with “Hello” → Kairo is alive.

---

NEW CHATGPT TAB?

If memory is lost, just type:
invoke: kairo sync memory from git

And everything will be remembered.
